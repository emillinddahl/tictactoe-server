Start the server:
To run the server in Eclipse, it is needed to be import in a new workshop in a new project.
Once imported, go to run->Run Configurations and make a new java Application.
Change the name of the java run configuration to 'server' and find the project location by browsing.
Then tell the Main class to be 'Server', just the project name.

Start the client:
To run the client in Eclipse, it is needed to be import in a new workshop in a new project.
Once imported, go to run->Run Configurations and make a new java Application.

Playing the game:
To run both server and clients at the same time, two session of Eclipse with two different workshops running 
is needed. First run the server and once a windows pops up, the server is running. afterward start two clients,
where the first one will be X and the second one will be O. To run multiple session of TicTacToe, keep the 
server running and run more clients.
